# Communicate-Data-Finding-project

## Dataset

>  The dataset during October 2018- April 2019 is downloaded from Ford GoBike and licensed by Ford GoBike. There are around 1.3 millions bike rides in the dataset with 16 features. Most variables are numeric variables which are about the start and end station mark, id, duration per trip, start time, end time, bike id, and member birth year. Categorical variables are start and end station id, user type, member gender, and bike share for all trip.

## Summary of Findings

> The growth in number of rides could be affected by the weather (It dropped on November and December)
> The majority of each characteristic traits are male, age around 28-37 years old, subsciber of Ford GoBike, and the start station is located in San Francisco
> Gender, user age group ans start location traits likely to have the similar pattern of user behaviours.
> User type trait show the significant difference in user behaviours such as duration usage, the peak hour of day, and which day users tend to ride a bike, etc. The subscriber use Ford Gobike in the weekday more than in the weekend and they mostly use Ford GoBike at 8am and 5pm. I assume that Ford Gobike's subscribers are employees or students, so they use a bike for traveling between home and work which spend around 10 minutes. On the other hand, casual customer have the steadily number of usage throughout a day and spend longer times than subscriber.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Most user type is subscriber who tend to use the bikeshare for daily routine transportation (maybe because it is either cheaper or faster). Thus, the most popular bike stations are around the public transportation (i.e trains, bus) or near workplace. On the other hand, casual customer likely to be a tourist who spend a longer duration per trip and they use bikeshare around the tourist attractions (i.e the Bay, farmer markets, and the park). In summary, Ford GoBike could use these characteristics and behaviours to launch the marketing offers that suit the target customer expectation, as well as, manage the number of bikes to meet user demands for the whole day.
